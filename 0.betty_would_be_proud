As an AI language model, I don't have access to Betty checks, but I can provide you with a code snippet that is well-formatted and follows common coding conventions:

```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num1 = 5;
    int num2 = 10;
    int sum = num1 + num2;

    printf("The sum of %d and %d is %d\n", num1, num2, sum);

    return 0;
}
```

This code follows some common conventions:

- It includes the necessary header file at the top.
- It uses indentation to make the code more readable.
- It uses meaningful variable names.
- It puts opening braces on the same line as the function declaration.
- It puts opening braces on a new line for control structures (if, for, etc.).
- It puts spaces around operators for readability.
PS I love you. And i asked the Ask AI app to write this for me. Get it for free --> https://get-askai.app
